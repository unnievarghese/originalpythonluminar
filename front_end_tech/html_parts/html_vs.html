    <h2>Langer rallies behind Paine, Smith amid criticism over SCG conduct</h2>
    <p> <strong>Justin Langer</strong>, the <i>Australian</i> head coach, has backed the captain <strong>Tim Paine</strong> following the 
        incidents at SCG Test, which ended in a thrilling draw. Through the course of the third match 
        of the ongoing <strong>Border-Gavaskar Trophy</strong>, the Australian captain made some unsavoury comments 
        directed at <strong>R Ashwin</strong> and even the umpires, for which he later apologised. It was far removed 
        from the conduct <i>Australia</i> had been attempting in their bid for a changed image of their 
        cricket team following the Sandpapergate.</p>
    <h2>Opportunities galore as Root's England embark on 17-Test journey</h2>
    <p>It was <strong>Albert Einstein</strong> who said, "In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity". He almost 
        certainly wasn't thinking of <i>England's</i> Test side at the time but his words resonate with the 
        position Joe Root's team find themselves in ahead of a two match series against <i>Sri Lanka </i>
        which begins a momentous, exacting year of Test cricket. The road ahead for <i>England</i> is clearly 
        difficult, but opportunities, for individuals and the collective, are there for the taking.</p>
